# Process Mining Project

## About

This project demonstrates the application of basic Process Mining techniques and algorithms using the [PM4PY](https://pm4py.fit.fraunhofer.de) library. It focuses on discovering process models from event logs, comparing algorithms like Alpha Miner and Heuristic Miner, and evaluating the quality of the discovered models using metrics such as fitness and precision.

## Structure

The repository has the following folder structure:

- _scripts_ : contains the Python scripts defined to run the Process Discovery and Conformance Checking algorithms.
- _images_ : contains the model from which the logs have been generated and the output models obtained from the Process Discovery algorithms.
- _documentation_ : contains the project's documentation
